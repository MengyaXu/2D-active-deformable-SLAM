============================
Active SLAM in deformable environment
============================

This is the code of the active deformable SLAM for the linear case and the nonlinear case. 

---------------
Quick start
---------------

For the linear case, run "main.m" to get the result.

For the nonlinear case, run "EKF_main.m" to get the result of using the EKF method.
Run "NLS_main.m" to get the result of using the nonlinear least square method.

For both cases, the noises can be pre-generated by running "getNoise.m".


--------------------------
Modes selection
--------------------------

Different modes can be selected by changing the option parameters at the beginning of 
- "main.m" for the linear case, and 
- "EKF_main.m" for the nonlinear case.

1. op
The way to generate the robot odometry in each step.
- op = 1, the robot odometry is predetermined.
- op = 2, the robot odometry is planned by the active SLAM algorithm.

2. op_trans
The transition path of the features.
- op_trans = 1, the feature path is a straight line to the right.
- op_trans = 2, the features move along a circular path.

3. op_noise
The distribution if the feature measurement noise.
- op_noise = 1, the feature measurement noise is irrelevant to the distance between the robot and the feature.
- op_noise = 2, the feature measurement noise is relevant to the distance between the robot and the feature.

The detailed introduction of the code and the display of the main results are in the .pdf files:
- "linear_KF.pdf" for the linear case,
- "nonlinear_EKF.pdf" for the nonlinear case using the EKF method, and
